Activate the virtual environment, then install `Turi Create` into within it

`conda activate venv`

`pip install -U turicreate`


To begin each development session, `cd` into this directory and activate your conda virtual environment

`conda activate venv`


When finished, deactivate it

`conda deactivate`
